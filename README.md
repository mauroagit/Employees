# Employees

App to list and search employees.
The employees come from an external Api, there is a page to list and search employees that uses a local Api.

Architecture:
Clean architecture, there are three layers Core, Infrastructure and Presentation(Web)
I've used Unity for Dependency Injection.

Unit Tests:
There are tests for some of the methods in all layers.
I've used Moq.
